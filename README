INTRODUCTION:
Gunderscript 2 is temporary name for the successor to the original Gunderscript
scripting language. For more information on Gunderscript, see
http://github.com/gundermanc/gunderscript

Gunderscript 2 attempts to learn from the mistakes of Gunderscript 1 and is a
completely new language that will be written from scratch in a combination of
C/C++ and Gunderscript. The focus is to create a clean, object oriented scripting
language that borrows the best features from C#, Java, C, and C++ and that is
small, efficient, and modular in design, allowing for the user to target either
the Gunderscript 2 interpreter or Gunderscript 2 VM.

ROADMAP:
  - Lexer : 100%
  - Parser (except for IF, FOR, WHILE, DO/WHILE and other control flow) : 100%
  - Syntax tree walker : 0%
  - Semantic (type checker), minus control flow : 0%
  - AST interpreter (non-compiled), minus control flow : 0%
  - End to end control flow support
    - IF : 0%
    - FOR : 0%
    - WHILE : 0%
    - DO/WHILE : 0%
  - Investigate more complex language features:
    - Exceptions
    - Switches
    - Enhanced or "shortcut" operators
  - Refactor and cleanup
  - Unified, extensible engine API.
  - Code generator for VM and VM : 0%

Gunderscript 2 is currently under initial construction. Tentative project
information can be found in arch.org file. If you are interested in joining this
project, I am in need of developers, a program manager, and code documentors.

ATTENTION:
I am seeking developers to help me complete Gunderscript 2 and test it. If anyone
is interested, please email gundermanc@gmail.com.

BUILDING:
Build the current code by generating build files for your platform with CMake.
Project has been tested on Windows 10 Professional 10586 and Ubuntu 15.04 and
should be able to run cross platform.
