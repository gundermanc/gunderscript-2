INTRODUCTION:
Gunderscript 2 is temporary name for the successor to the original Gunderscript
scripting language. For more information on Gunderscript, see
http://github.com/gundermanc/gunderscript

Gunderscript 2 attempts to learn from the mistakes of Gunderscript 1 and is a
completely new language that will be written from scratch in a combination of
C/C++ and Gunderscript. The focus is to create a clean, object oriented scripting
language that borrows the best features from C#, Java, C, and C++ and that is
small, efficient, and modular in design, allowing for the user to target either
the Gunderscript 2 VM or native platforms such as x86/64 and ARM.

IMPLEMENTATION PROGESS:
  - Lexer : 100%
  - SymbolTable : 100%
  - See Issues on Github for more info.

Gunderscript 2 is currently under initial construction. Tentative project
information can be found in arch.org file. If you are interested in joining this
project, I am in need of developers, a program manager, and code documentors.

ATTENTION:
I am seeking developers to help me complete Gunderscript 2 and test it. If anyone
is interested, please email gundermanc@gmail.com.

BUILDING:
Build the current code by running 'make all-release' in the root directory.
Build the debug configuration by running 'make all-debug' in the root directory.
Build the library unit tests by running 'make all-test' in the library directory.
